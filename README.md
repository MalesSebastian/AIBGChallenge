### The project that took the first prize at the [AI Battleground](http://aibg.besttm.ro/) hackathon.

***
## What is Artificial Intelligence Battleground?
Artificial Intelligence BattleGround is a programming competition using Artificial Intelligence algorithms.
Teams of up to 2 people will work for 20 hours to schedule according to the requirements, and will compete in a game against other teams.

## What is the game about?
The task was to develop an AI algorithm, that had to compete against other teams's algorithm in a specific game.
The game was developed by the organizing team, and the goal was to gain as much ground as possible against opponents.

## What have we done?
We developed an algorithm that creates a certain pattern in order to fill the map with "indestructible" blocks, otherwise it was spreading randomly in free areas.
